description: 'Feelings are not good or bad, judging your emotions keeps you from really understanding what it is that you are really feeling. When you suspend judgment of emotions you allow them to run their course and eventually vanish. Remember that the feelings of your emotions are there to remind you and to help you understand something important.Your emotions whether they’re positive or negative have a ripple effect; they affect the people surrounding you--and as time goes by, if it’s an emotion that you’ve been holding on to--it can start creating tensions with the people you care about, from your close relationship to your distant acquaintances. It is crucial to self-assess and dig deeper into your emotions to be able to move on from the situation you’re in. Not digging deep or self-assessing into your own emotions will cause you to be stagnant and stationary. It will create a root within you, as time progresses you will be governed from the emotions you hold within. You’ll be a slave to your emotions. Examine yourself, your behavior, actions, thoughts, and feelings to finally move forward in life. Apologize to who you have to, let go of the grudges that are rooting your life stagnant, and be free. Let go.'
